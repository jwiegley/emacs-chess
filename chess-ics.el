;;; Commentary:

;; This module allows to play chess on an Internet Chess Server.
;; Contrary to other chess engine modules for chess.el, you are not supposed to
;; use `chess-ics' as an engine for `M-x chess', rather, you call
;; `M-x chess-ics' directly to play chess on the internet.
;;
;; The two major Internet Chess Servers, freechess.org and chessclub.com
;; are both supported.  See `chess-ics-server-list' for the supported servers.
